# FuncTion

FuncTion is a research prototype static analyzer designed for proving conditional termination and conditional guarantee and recurrence properties of C programs. The tool automatically infers piecewise-defined ranking functions and sufficient preconditions for termination, guarantee and recurrence properties by means of abstract interpretation.

FuncTion was developed to implement and test the analysis method and abstract domains described in the articles:

# Installation

FuncTion requires the following applications and libraries:

* OCaml 

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-interp
	```

* Findlib

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install ocaml-findlib
	```

* Menhir: LR(1) parser generator

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install menhir
	```
  
* Opam: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

	```
	(sudo) apt-get install opam
	```
  
* OUnit

	```
	opam install ounit
	```

* APRON: numerical abstract domain library

	```
	opam install apron
	```


# Compiling FuncTion

Once all required libraries are installed, FuncTion can be compiled with 'make':

```
make
```

This will generate the command line program 'function' in the project directory. 

Alternatively, 'ocamlbuild' can be used to compile either a native or bytecode version with the following commands:

```
ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -use-menhir -pkgs 'apron,gmp,oUnit' -I utils -I domains -I frontend -I main -libs boxMPQ,octD,polkaMPQ,str Main.byte
```

```
ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -use-menhir -pkgs 'apron,gmp,oUnit' -I utils -I domains -I frontend -I main -libs boxMPQ,octD,polkaMPQ,str Main.native
```

# Usage

The command-line analyzer can be invoked using the following call pattern:

	./function <file> 

where <file> is the path to the C file to be analyzed for termination of the function main(). Alternatively, the following call pattern can be used for guarantee properties or recurrence properties:

	./function <file> [-guarantee <property> | -recurrence <property]

where <property> is the path to the file containing the guarantee or recurrence property.

The analyzer first performs a forward reachability analysis, and then a backward analysis to find a piecewise-defined ranking function and sufficient preconditions at the entry point for the program to always terminate or satisfy the given guarantee or recurrence property.

The following command-line options are recognized
(showing their default value):

	 -main main                         set the analyzer entry point (defaults to main)
	 -domain boxes|octagons|polyhedra   set the abstract domain (defaults to boxes)
	 -joinfwd 2                         set the widening delay in forward analysis
	 -joinbwd 2                         set the widening delay in backward analysis
	 -meetbwd 2			    set the dual widening delay in backward analysis
	 -ordinals 2                        set the maximum ordinal value for the ranking functions
	 -refine			    reduces the backward analysis to the reachabile states

The analyzer answers TRUE in case it can successfully prove termination or the guarantee or recurrence property. 
Otherwise, it answers UNKNOWN.
