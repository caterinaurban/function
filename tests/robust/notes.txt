A) In num 1.2 : we can infer x uncontrolled
   but in 2.3 we cannot. there are some inequalities to resolve. 


B) Close rmk in num4. We have n uncontrolled. But we  need to resolve that.



C) Should we take l+1 or  l : (4 or 5)

Global scheme: look at the counting function after decls. Look if there exist a decreasing path toward the bug where some variable are non-constraint.
               If yes these variable could be uncontrolled. Other must be controlled. 
               Pb: resolve inequalities
